# Summary

A hobby project to make a tactics game focused on intelligence gathering.

The goal of the game is to make a tactics game inspired by Advanced Wars, but with an espionage and campaign tactics element.

Resources can be spent on building units, or on gathering information on what the enemy is doing.

While battles focus on a single battlefield, meta decisions need to be made about which battlefields resources should be committed to.
